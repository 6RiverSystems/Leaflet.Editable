#Â Leaflet.Editable

Make geometries editable in Leaflet.

This is not a plug and play UI, and will not. This is a minimal, lightweight,
and fully extendable API to control editing of geometries. So you can easily
build your own UI with your own needs and choices.

See the [demo UI](http://yohanboniface.github.io/Leaflet.Editable/example/index.html).

Design keys:

- only the core needs
- no UI, but hooks everywhere needed
- everything programatically controlable
- MultiPolygon/MultiPolyline support
- Polygons' holes support
- touch support
- tests


**Considered pre-alpha. Under active developpement, many things can change
before a proprer release.**
